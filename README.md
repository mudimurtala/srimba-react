# Scrimba React Project

This project is a minimal React app bootstrapped with Vite. It demonstrates a simple setup with custom styling and a basic React component.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: Loads Bootstrap from CDN, links the custom CSS, sets up a root div, and loads the React entry point (`index.jsx`).
- **index.css**: Applies a dark background, white text, Arial font, and centers content.
- **index.jsx**: Renders a React section containing an image (`react-logo.png`) and a heading: "This is another element".

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
	```bash
	npm install
	```
2. Start the development server:
	```bash
	npm run dev
	```

## Features

- Uses [React](https://react.dev/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- Custom CSS for styling
- Bootstrap included via CDN

## Example Output

The app displays a centered section with a React logo and a heading.
